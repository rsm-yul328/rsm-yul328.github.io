    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nTo briefly summarize the design: 50,083 past donors were randomly assigned to one of two groups—a control group (which received a standard appeal) and a treatment group (which received a matching offer). Within the treatment group, donors were further randomly assigned to one of several specific conditions: - Match ratios: 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 (e.g., a $50 donation with a 2:1 match results in $150 total) - Match thresholds: limits of $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or no cap - Suggested donation amounts: equal to, 1.25×, or 1.5× the donor’s previous maximum gift\nThe core message and layout of each letter remained the same—only the matching and suggestion elements varied. The goal was to test how these subtle framing differences affected both whether people chose to donate and how much they gave.\nIn this project, I replicate their study using the original dataset, examining both the balance across groups and the causal impact of different treatments on giving behavior."

The primary outcome variables include gave, indicating whether the person donated (mean = 0.0207), and amount, the dollar amount contributed (mean ≈ $0.92, conditional on giving). Most donors gave nothing, which is reflected by the median of $0.\nTreatment conditions are encoded with variables such as: - treatment: whether the respondent received a matching offer (≈ 66.7% did) - ratio: numeric indicator of the match ratio (mean ≈ 1.33) - ratio2 and ratio3: dummy variables for 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios - size25, size50, size100, sizeno: match threshold treatment groups\nSuggested donation levels are represented by ask, ask1, ask2, and ask3. Donor history is captured by variables such as freq (mean ≈ 8.04 prior donations), years (mean ≈ 6.10 years since first donation), and mrm2 (months since last donation, mean ≈ 13.0).\nDemographic and geographic controls include gender (female: ≈ 27.8%), relationship status (couple: ≈ 9.1%), political environment (red0, blue0), and census-level data like median_hhincome and pwhite.\nMost variables are binary indicators for treatment groups or demographics, and many are highly skewed, with means much lower than maximums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states; 0 otherwise\n\n\nnonlit\nNonlitigation\n\n\ncases\nCourt cases from state in 2004-5 in which organization was involved\n\n\nstatecnt\nPercent of sample from state\n\n\nstateresponse\nProportion of sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponset\nProportion of treated sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsec\nProportion of control sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsetminc\nstateresponset - stateresponsec\n\n\nperbush\nState vote share for Bush\n\n\nclose25\nState vote share for Bush between 47.5% and 52.5%\n\n\nred0\nRed state\n\n\nblue0\nBlue state\n\n\nredcty\nRed county\n\n\nbluecty\nBlue county\n\n\npwhite\nProportion white within zip code\n\n\npblack\nProportion black within zip code\n\n\npage18_39\nProportion age 18-39 within zip code\n\n\nave_hh_sz\nAverage household size within zip code\n\n\nmedian_hhincome\nMedian household income within zip code\n\n\npowner\nProportion house owner within zip code\n\n\npsch_atlstba\nProportion who finished college within zip code\n\n\npop_propurban\nProportion of population urban within zip code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Test\nAs an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\nTo answer this, I conducted both t-tests and simple linear regressions comparing the following baseline variables across groups:\n\nmrm2: months since last donation\n\nfemale: gender indicator\n\nfreq: number of prior donations\n\nred0: whether the donor lives in a Bush-won (red) state\n\nThese variables help capture a mix of behavioral, demographic, and geographic features. For each one, I compute both the raw difference in means (via t-test) and the estimated treatment effect from a linear regression with treatment as the only predictor.\nThe table below summarizes the results:\n\nTTest_Diff: difference in means between groups\n\nReg_Estimate: coefficient on treatment from a linear model\n\np-values are reported for both approaches to assess statistical significance\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\ncovariates &lt;- c(\"mrm2\", \"female\", \"freq\", \"red0\")\n\nbalance_results &lt;- data.frame(\n  Variable = character(),\n  TTest_Diff = numeric(),\n  TTest_p = numeric(),\n  Reg_Estimate = numeric(),\n  Reg_SE = numeric(),\n  Reg_p = numeric(),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nfor (var in covariates) {\n  # T-test\n  ttest &lt;- t.test(data[[var]] ~ data$treatment)\n  \n  # Regression\n  reg &lt;- lm(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)\n  reg_coef &lt;- tidy(reg) %&gt;% filter(term == \"treatment\")\n  \n  balance_results &lt;- rbind(balance_results, data.frame(\n    Variable = var,\n    TTest_Diff = round(diff(ttest$estimate), 4),\n    TTest_p = round(ttest$p.value, 4),\n    Reg_Estimate = round(reg_coef$estimate, 4),\n    Reg_SE = round(reg_coef$std.error, 4),\n    Reg_p = round(reg_coef$p.value, 4)\n  ))\n}\n\n\nkable(balance_results, caption = \"Balance Test: Comparison of T-Test and Regression Results\")\n\n\nBalance Test: Comparison of T-Test and Regression Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nTTest_Diff\nTTest_p\nReg_Estimate\nReg_SE\nReg_p\n\n\n\n\nmean in group 1\nmrm2\n0.0137\n0.9049\n0.0137\n0.1145\n0.9049\n\n\nmean in group 11\nfemale\n-0.0075\n0.0795\n-0.0075\n0.0043\n0.0787\n\n\nmean in group 12\nfreq\n-0.0120\n0.9117\n-0.0120\n0.1080\n0.9117\n\n\nmean in group 13\nred0\n0.0087\n0.0605\n0.0087\n0.0047\n0.0608\n\n\n\n\n\nThe balance test results show that none of the selected variables differ significantly between the treatment and control groups. All p-values from both the t-tests and regressions are well above the conventional 0.05 threshold.\nThis is good news—it suggests that the randomization worked as intended. The treatment and control groups appear statistically similar in terms of donation history (mrm2, freq), gender (female), and political environment (red0).\nThese findings are consistent with Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), which reports no significant differences across a wide range of covariates. By confirming that the two groups were well-balanced at baseline, we can more confidently attribute any differences in donation outcomes to the treatment itself."

The treatment group, which received a letter including a matching donation offer, had a visibly higher donation rate than the control group, which received a standard fundraising letter.

Both the t-test and regression estimate a difference of about 0.42 percentage points, and the results are statistically significant with p-values below 0.01.\nTo further validate this finding, I also estimated a probit model with treatment as the sole predictor. While the probit coefficient itself is not directly interpretable, the average marginal effect (AME) reveals that the matching offer increases the donation probability by about 0.43 percentage points, consistent with the linear model.\nThese results closely align with Table 2A in Karlan and List (2007). Although the effect size is modest, the large sample size allows for precise estimation. From a behavioral perspective, it shows that even small nudges—like a matching offer—can meaningfully increase participation in charitable giving. Framing matters.\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), data = data)\n\nprobit_result &lt;- tidy(probit_model)\n\nprobit_result %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"treatment\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  term      estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 treatment   0.0868    0.0279      3.11  0.0019\n\n\n\nlibrary(margins)\nmfx &lt;- margins(probit_model)\nsummary(mfx)\n\n    factor    AME     SE      z      p  lower  upper\n treatment 0.0043 0.0014 3.1045 0.0019 0.0016 0.0070\n\n\nTo further explore how the treatment influenced the likelihood of donating, I estimated a probit model using gave as the outcome and treatment as the only predictor.\nThe probit coefficient for the treatment group was 0.0868, and it was statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.0019). However, this number reflects a change on a latent index scale, which isn’t directly interpretable in terms of actual donation probabilities.\nTo get a more intuitive estimate, I used the margins package to calculate the average marginal effect (AME). The result shows that being assigned to the treatment group increases the probability of donating by about 0.43 percentage points (AME = 0.0043, p = 0.0019).\nThis finding is nearly identical to the linear regression result and matches what Karlan and List reported in Table 3, Column 1 of their original paper. Taken together, the t-test, linear model, and probit model all provide consistent evidence that matching offers significantly increase the likelihood of giving—even if the effect is relatively small. It’s a powerful reminder that framing and behavioral nudges can meaningfully influence donor decisions.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\ntreat_only &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1)\nt_1_vs_2 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 2), data = treat_only)\nt_2_vs_3 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 3), data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(2, 3)))\nt_1_vs_3 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 3), data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(1, 3)))\n\nttest_table &lt;- bind_rows(\n  tidy(t_1_vs_2) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"1:1 vs 2:1\"),\n  tidy(t_2_vs_3) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"2:1 vs 3:1\"),\n  tidy(t_1_vs_3) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"1:1 vs 3:1\")\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Mean_Group_A = round(estimate1, 4),\n    Mean_Group_B = round(estimate2, 4),\n    Difference = round(estimate2 - estimate1, 4),\n    CI = paste0(\"[\", round(conf.low, 4), \", \", round(conf.high, 4), \"]\"),\n    p_value = round(p.value, 4)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(Comparison, Mean_Group_A, Mean_Group_B, Difference, CI, p_value)\n\nkable(ttest_table, caption = \"T-Test Comparison of Donation Rates Across Match Ratios\")\n\n\nT-Test Comparison of Donation Rates Across Match Ratios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nMean_Group_A\nMean_Group_B\nDifference\nCI\np_value\n\n\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1\n0.0217\n0.0226\n9e-04\n[-0.0043, 0.0025]\n0.6029\n\n\n2:1 vs 3:1\n0.0226\n0.0227\n1e-04\n[-0.004, 0.0038]\n0.9600\n\n\n1:1 vs 3:1\n0.0207\n0.0227\n2e-03\n[-0.0058, 0.0018]\n0.3101\n\n\n\n\n\nI compared the donation response rates among treatment groups that received different match ratios—1:1, 2:1, and 3:1—using pairwise t-tests.\nAcross all comparisons, the differences in response rates were extremely small (less than 0.2 percentage points) and statistically insignificant. For example, donors offered a 3:1 match were no more likely to give than those offered a 1:1 or 2:1 match.\nThese results reinforce one of the key insights from Karlan and List (2007): larger match ratios don’t necessarily increase donation rates. What seems to matter most is the existence of a match—regardless of how generous it is.\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, this suggests that donors are influenced by the idea of their gift being matched, but may not pay close attention to the specific match size. The framing effect—“your donation will be matched”—appears to be powerful enough on its own\n\nreg_ratio &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = treat_only)\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_ratio, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   0.0207    0.0014    14.9     0       0.018     0.0235\n2 ratio2        0.0019    0.002      0.958   0.338  -0.002     0.0057\n3 ratio3        0.002     0.002      1.01    0.313  -0.0019    0.0058\n\n\nTo further investigate whether the size of the match ratio influences donation behavior, I ran a linear regression using only the treatment group. In this model, ratio2 and ratio3 are indicator variables for the 2:1 and 3:1 match conditions. The 1:1 match group serves as the baseline, so the intercept represents the average donation rate for donors who received a 1:1 match.\nThe estimated donation rate under the 1:1 match was 2.07%, which is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The 2:1 and 3:1 match groups had slightly higher rates—2.26% and 2.27%, respectively—but the differences (coefficients of 0.0019 and 0.0020) were not statistically significant (p = 0.3383 and 0.3133).\nThese findings are consistent with earlier t-test results and with the original study by Karlan and List (2007). They suggest that increasing the match ratio doesn’t meaningfully affect donation likelihood. Instead, it appears that the key behavioral lever is simply the presence of a match offer, not how generous the match is.\n\nmean_by_ratio &lt;- treat_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(ratio) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nmean_by_ratio\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      ratio response_rate\n  &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1        0.0207\n2         2        0.0226\n3         3        0.0227\n\n\n\ndiff_2_1 &lt;- mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 2] - mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 1]\ndiff_3_2 &lt;- mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 3] - mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 2]\n\ndiff_2_1\n\n[1] 0.001884251\n\ndiff_3_2\n\n[1] 0.000100024\n\n\n\ncoef_table &lt;- tidy(reg_ratio)\n\nbaseline &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"(Intercept)\"]\ncoef_2_1 &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"ratio2\"]\ncoef_3_1 &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"ratio3\"]\n\nfitted_2 &lt;- baseline + coef_2_1\nfitted_3 &lt;- baseline + coef_3_1\n\ndiff_2_1_fitted &lt;- coef_2_1\ndiff_3_2_fitted &lt;- coef_3_1 - coef_2_1\n\ndiff_2_1_fitted\n\n[1] 0.001884251\n\ndiff_3_2_fitted\n\n[1] 0.000100024\n\n\nTo further assess the effectiveness of different match sizes, I compared donation rates between match ratios using two approaches:\n(1) directly from the observed data, and\n(2) indirectly using fitted values from the regression model.\nThe difference in donation rates between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups was approximately 0.00188, or 0.19 percentage points. Between the 2:1 and 3:1 match groups, the difference was only 0.00010, or 0.01 percentage points. These differences were exactly confirmed using the regression coefficients, which adds confidence to the consistency of the findings.\nWhile the differences are numerically real, both are very small in magnitude and, as shown earlier, not statistically significant. This reinforces the conclusion that although a matching offer increases donations compared to no match, increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not meaningfully boost response rates.\nThe key takeaway is clear: the existence of a match matters more than its generosity. For fundraisers, this insight suggests that match framing can be powerful—even without increasing the cost of the match itself.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nt_test_amount &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\n\nreg_amount &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_amount, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    0.813    0.0674     12.1   0        0.681      0.945\n2 treatment      0.154    0.0826      1.86  0.0628  -0.0082     0.315\n\n\nI began by examining the effect of the treatment on total donation amounts using a simple linear regression. This analysis includes all individuals, regardless of whether they actually donated.\nThe results show that participants in the treatment group gave, on average, $0.15 more than those in the control group (estimate = 0.1536). However, this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.0628).\nThis suggests that while the treatment group may have contributed slightly more overall, the difference could be driven primarily by a higher number of people donating, not by larger gifts among donors. In other words, this part of the analysis reflects the extensive margin (whether someone donates), not the intensive margin (how much they give once they do).\n\ndonors_only &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\nreg_amount_conditional &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = donors_only)\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_amount_conditional, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    45.5       2.42    18.8     0        40.8      50.3 \n2 treatment      -1.67      2.87    -0.581   0.562    -7.30      3.97\n\n\nNext, I restricted the analysis to only those individuals who actually made a donation.\nAmong donors, the average donation amount in the control group was $45.54, while donors in the treatment group gave $1.67 less on average. This difference is again not statistically significant (p = 0.5615).\nThese results suggest that once someone decides to donate, the matching offer has no clear effect on how much they give. Combined with the earlier finding that matching increases the likelihood of giving, this implies that the treatment works mainly by encouraging people to donate, not by changing donation size.\n\ndonors_only &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(gave == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = ifelse(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\"))\n\nmean_amounts &lt;- donors_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_amt = mean(amount, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(donors_only, aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(data = mean_amounts,\n             aes(xintercept = mean_amt),\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ group) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Donation Amounts by Group (Among Donors Only)\",\n    x = \"Donation Amount ($)\",\n    y = \"Number of Donors\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram above shows the distribution of donation amounts for each group.\nAt first glance, the two distributions appear almost identical—both are centered around $45–$50 and have a similar shape. The dashed red lines represent the group averages: approximately $45.5 for the control group and slightly lower for the treatment group.\nSurprisingly, those in the treatment group actually gave a bit less than the control group. But again, this difference is not statistically meaningful, and most likely due to random variation.\nSo what can we take away from this? While a matching offer can successfully nudge people to donate, it doesn’t influence how generous they are once they’ve made that decision. The effect seems to operate on whether someone acts, not how much they give—an important insight for designing effective fundraising strategies."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\nset.seed(42)\n\ncontrol &lt;- rbinom(10000, size = 1, prob = 0.018)\ntreatment &lt;- rbinom(10000, size = 1, prob = 0.022)\n\ndiffs &lt;- treatment - control\n\ncumulative_avg &lt;- cumsum(diffs) / seq_along(diffs)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nplot_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Draw = 1:10000,\n  CumulativeAverage = cumulative_avg\n)\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Draw, y = CumulativeAverage)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.004, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cumulative Average of Treatment - Control Donations (Simulated)\",\n    subtitle = \"Demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers\",\n    x = \"Number of Simulations\",\n    y = \"Cumulative Average of Differences\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simulation clearly demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers in action.\nAs we simulate more and more observations, the cumulative average difference in donation rates between the treatment and control groups steadily converges to the true expected value of 0.004. Early on, we see a lot of noise—the line bounces around as randomness dominates small sample sizes. But as the number of simulations increases, the fluctuations smooth out and the line settles near the true value.\nThis convergence gives us confidence in the reliability of our estimates. The more data we collect, the closer we get to the underlying truth—even when individual observations are binary and noisy, like whether someone donates.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nsample_sizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\nnum_simulations &lt;- 1000\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──\n\n\n✔ tibble  3.1.5     ✔ purrr   1.0.2\n✔ tidyr   1.1.4     ✔ stringr 1.4.0\n✔ readr   2.0.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nsim_results &lt;- lapply(sample_sizes, function(n) {\n  diffs &lt;- replicate(num_simulations, {\n    treat &lt;- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.022)\n    control &lt;- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.018)\n    mean(treat) - mean(control)\n  })\n  tibble(\n    diff = diffs,\n    sample_size = n\n  )\n}) %&gt;% bind_rows()\n\n\nggplot(sim_results, aes(x = diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ sample_size, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Simulated Mean Differences\",\n    subtitle = \"Across Varying Sample Sizes (Central Limit Theorem)\",\n    x = \"Average Treatment - Control\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histograms below illustrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in action.\nFor each sample size—50, 200, 500, and 1000—I repeatedly simulated the average difference in donation rates between a treatment group (with donation probability = 0.022) and a control group (0.018). Each histogram shows the distribution of these simulated mean differences.\nAs the sample size increases, the distribution becomes smoother, more symmetric, and narrower. With only 50 observations, the results are jagged and spread out—random chance can easily mask the treatment effect. But by the time we reach 1000 observations, the distribution clusters tightly around the true value (≈ 0.004), and resembles a classic bell curve.\nThe red dashed line at zero represents the “no effect” case. In small samples, it’s often close to the center of the distribution. But in large samples, zero moves to the tail, meaning the evidence increasingly rules out no effect.\nThis is exactly why the CLT is so powerful in applied work: with large enough samples, our estimates become well-behaved, normally distributed, and centered near the truth, even when the raw data is binary and highly skewed."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis replication of Karlan and List (2007) confirmed several key insights about how simple behavioral cues can shape charitable giving.\nI was especially struck by how just the presence of a match—regardless of its size—was enough to increase donation rates. Whether the offer was 1:1 or 3:1, donors were equally likely to give. What mattered most was the framing: knowing their donation would be matched seemed to motivate action.\nInterestingly, once people decided to donate, the matching offer didn’t affect how much they gave. This suggests that the treatment primarily affects the decision to give (the extensive margin), rather than the donation amount (the intensive margin).\nAs someone studying data science and business analytics, this project reminded me that small psychological shifts can lead to measurable real-world effects. For fundraisers or policymakers, it’s a strong case for thoughtful design and messaging.\nSometimes, it’s not about offering more. It’s about offering it more effectively."

    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nTo briefly summarize the design: 50,083 past donors were randomly assigned to one of two groups—a control group (which received a standard appeal) and a treatment group (which received a matching offer). Within the treatment group, donors were further randomly assigned to one of several specific conditions: - Match ratios: 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 (e.g., a $50 donation with a 2:1 match results in $150 total) - Match thresholds: limits of $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or no cap - Suggested donation amounts: equal to, 1.25×, or 1.5× the donor’s previous maximum gift\nThe core message and layout of each letter remained the same—only the matching and suggestion elements varied. The goal was to test how these subtle framing differences affected both whether people chose to donate and how much they gave.\nIn this project, I replicate their study using the original dataset, examining both the balance across groups and the causal impact of different treatments on giving behavior."

50,083 observations, each representing a previous donor who received a fundraising solicitation as part of Karlan and List’s field experiment. The primary outcome variables include gave, indicating whether the person donated (mean = 0.0207), and amount, the dollar amount contributed (mean ≈ $0.92, conditional on giving). Most donors gave nothing, which is reflected by the median of $0.\nTreatment conditions are encoded with variables such as: - treatment: whether the respondent received a matching offer (≈ 66.7% did) - ratio: numeric indicator of the match ratio (mean ≈ 1.33) - ratio2 and ratio3: dummy variables for 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios - size25, size50, size100, sizeno: match threshold treatment groups\nSuggested donation levels are represented by ask, ask1, ask2, and ask3. Donor history is captured by variables such as freq (mean ≈ 8.04 prior donations), years (mean ≈ 6.10 years since first donation), and mrm2 (months since last donation, mean ≈ 13.0).\nDemographic and geographic controls include gender (female: ≈ 27.8%), relationship status (couple: ≈ 9.1%), political environment (red0, blue0), and census-level data like median_hhincome and pwhite.\nMost variables are binary indicators for treatment groups or demographics, and many are highly skewed, with means much lower than maximums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states; 0 otherwise\n\n\nnonlit\nNonlitigation\n\n\ncases\nCourt cases from state in 2004-5 in which organization was involved\n\n\nstatecnt\nPercent of sample from state\n\n\nstateresponse\nProportion of sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponset\nProportion of treated sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsec\nProportion of control sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsetminc\nstateresponset - stateresponsec\n\n\nperbush\nState vote share for Bush\n\n\nclose25\nState vote share for Bush between 47.5% and 52.5%\n\n\nred0\nRed state\n\n\nblue0\nBlue state\n\n\nredcty\nRed county\n\n\nbluecty\nBlue county\n\n\npwhite\nProportion white within zip code\n\n\npblack\nProportion black within zip code\n\n\npage18_39\nProportion age 18-39 within zip code\n\n\nave_hh_sz\nAverage household size within zip code\n\n\nmedian_hhincome\nMedian household income within zip code\n\n\npowner\nProportion house owner within zip code\n\n\npsch_atlstba\nProportion who finished college within zip code\n\n\npop_propurban\nProportion of population urban within zip code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Test\nAs an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\nTo answer this, I conducted both t-tests and simple linear regressions comparing the following baseline variables across groups:\n\nmrm2: months since last donation\n\nfemale: gender indicator\n\nfreq: number of prior donations\n\nred0: whether the donor lives in a Bush-won (red) state\n\nThese variables help capture a mix of behavioral, demographic, and geographic features. For each one, I compute both the raw difference in means (via t-test) and the estimated treatment effect from a linear regression with treatment as the only predictor.\nThe table below summarizes the results:\n\nTTest_Diff: difference in means between groups\n\nReg_Estimate: coefficient on treatment from a linear model\n\np-values are reported for both approaches to assess statistical significance\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\ncovariates &lt;- c(\"mrm2\", \"female\", \"freq\", \"red0\")\n\nbalance_results &lt;- data.frame(\n  Variable = character(),\n  TTest_Diff = numeric(),\n  TTest_p = numeric(),\n  Reg_Estimate = numeric(),\n  Reg_SE = numeric(),\n  Reg_p = numeric(),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nfor (var in covariates) {\n  # T-test\n  ttest &lt;- t.test(data[[var]] ~ data$treatment)\n  \n  # Regression\n  reg &lt;- lm(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)\n  reg_coef &lt;- tidy(reg) %&gt;% filter(term == \"treatment\")\n  \n  balance_results &lt;- rbind(balance_results, data.frame(\n    Variable = var,\n    TTest_Diff = round(diff(ttest$estimate), 4),\n    TTest_p = round(ttest$p.value, 4),\n    Reg_Estimate = round(reg_coef$estimate, 4),\n    Reg_SE = round(reg_coef$std.error, 4),\n    Reg_p = round(reg_coef$p.value, 4)\n  ))\n}\n\n\nkable(balance_results, caption = \"Balance Test: Comparison of T-Test and Regression Results\")\n\n\nBalance Test: Comparison of T-Test and Regression Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nTTest_Diff\nTTest_p\nReg_Estimate\nReg_SE\nReg_p\n\n\n\n\nmean in group 1\nmrm2\n0.0137\n0.9049\n0.0137\n0.1145\n0.9049\n\n\nmean in group 11\nfemale\n-0.0075\n0.0795\n-0.0075\n0.0043\n0.0787\n\n\nmean in group 12\nfreq\n-0.0120\n0.9117\n-0.0120\n0.1080\n0.9117\n\n\nmean in group 13\nred0\n0.0087\n0.0605\n0.0087\n0.0047\n0.0608\n\n\n\n\n\nThe balance test results show that none of the selected variables differ significantly between the treatment and control groups. All p-values from both the t-tests and regressions are well above the conventional 0.05 threshold.\nThis is good news—it suggests that the randomization worked as intended. The treatment and control groups appear statistically similar in terms of donation history (mrm2, freq), gender (female), and political environment (red0).\nThese findings are consistent with Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), which reports no significant differences across a wide range of covariates. By confirming that the two groups were well-balanced at baseline, we can more confidently attribute any differences in donation outcomes to the treatment itself."

The treatment group, which received a letter including a matching donation offer, had a visibly higher donation rate than the control group, which received a standard fundraising letter.

Both the t-test and regression estimate a difference of about 0.42 percentage points, and the results are statistically significant with p-values below 0.01.\nTo further validate this finding, I also estimated a probit model with treatment as the sole predictor. While the probit coefficient itself is not directly interpretable, the average marginal effect (AME) reveals that the matching offer increases the donation probability by about 0.43 percentage points, consistent with the linear model.\nThese results closely align with Table 2A in Karlan and List (2007). Although the effect size is modest, the large sample size allows for precise estimation. From a behavioral perspective, it shows that even small nudges—like a matching offer—can meaningfully increase participation in charitable giving. Framing matters.\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), data = data)\n\nprobit_result &lt;- tidy(probit_model)\n\nprobit_result %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"treatment\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  term      estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 treatment   0.0868    0.0279      3.11  0.0019\n\n\n\nlibrary(margins)\nmfx &lt;- margins(probit_model)\nsummary(mfx)\n\n    factor    AME     SE      z      p  lower  upper\n treatment 0.0043 0.0014 3.1045 0.0019 0.0016 0.0070\n\n\nTo further explore how the treatment influenced the likelihood of donating, I estimated a probit model using gave as the outcome and treatment as the only predictor.\nThe probit coefficient for the treatment group was 0.0868, and it was statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.0019). However, this number reflects a change on a latent index scale, which isn’t directly interpretable in terms of actual donation probabilities.\nTo get a more intuitive estimate, I used the margins package to calculate the average marginal effect (AME). The result shows that being assigned to the treatment group increases the probability of donating by about 0.43 percentage points (AME = 0.0043, p = 0.0019).\nThis finding is nearly identical to the linear regression result and matches what Karlan and List reported in Table 3, Column 1 of their original paper. Taken together, the t-test, linear model, and probit model all provide consistent evidence that matching offers significantly increase the likelihood of giving—even if the effect is relatively small. It’s a powerful reminder that framing and behavioral nudges can meaningfully influence donor decisions.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\ntreat_only &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1)\nt_1_vs_2 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 2), data = treat_only)\nt_2_vs_3 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 3), data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(2, 3)))\nt_1_vs_3 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ (ratio == 3), data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(1, 3)))\n\nttest_table &lt;- bind_rows(\n  tidy(t_1_vs_2) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"1:1 vs 2:1\"),\n  tidy(t_2_vs_3) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"2:1 vs 3:1\"),\n  tidy(t_1_vs_3) %&gt;% mutate(Comparison = \"1:1 vs 3:1\")\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Mean_Group_A = round(estimate1, 4),\n    Mean_Group_B = round(estimate2, 4),\n    Difference = round(estimate2 - estimate1, 4),\n    CI = paste0(\"[\", round(conf.low, 4), \", \", round(conf.high, 4), \"]\"),\n    p_value = round(p.value, 4)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(Comparison, Mean_Group_A, Mean_Group_B, Difference, CI, p_value)\n\nkable(ttest_table, caption = \"T-Test Comparison of Donation Rates Across Match Ratios\")\n\n\nT-Test Comparison of Donation Rates Across Match Ratios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nMean_Group_A\nMean_Group_B\nDifference\nCI\np_value\n\n\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1\n0.0217\n0.0226\n9e-04\n[-0.0043, 0.0025]\n0.6029\n\n\n2:1 vs 3:1\n0.0226\n0.0227\n1e-04\n[-0.004, 0.0038]\n0.9600\n\n\n1:1 vs 3:1\n0.0207\n0.0227\n2e-03\n[-0.0058, 0.0018]\n0.3101\n\n\n\n\n\nI compared the donation response rates among treatment groups that received different match ratios—1:1, 2:1, and 3:1—using pairwise t-tests.\nAcross all comparisons, the differences in response rates were extremely small (less than 0.2 percentage points) and statistically insignificant. For example, donors offered a 3:1 match were no more likely to give than those offered a 1:1 or 2:1 match.\nThese results reinforce one of the key insights from Karlan and List (2007): larger match ratios don’t necessarily increase donation rates. What seems to matter most is the existence of a match—regardless of how generous it is.\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, this suggests that donors are influenced by the idea of their gift being matched, but may not pay close attention to the specific match size. The framing effect—“your donation will be matched”—appears to be powerful enough on its own\n\nreg_ratio &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = treat_only)\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_ratio, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   0.0207    0.0014    14.9     0       0.018     0.0235\n2 ratio2        0.0019    0.002      0.958   0.338  -0.002     0.0057\n3 ratio3        0.002     0.002      1.01    0.313  -0.0019    0.0058\n\n\nTo further investigate whether the size of the match ratio influences donation behavior, I ran a linear regression using only the treatment group. In this model, ratio2 and ratio3 are indicator variables for the 2:1 and 3:1 match conditions. The 1:1 match group serves as the baseline, so the intercept represents the average donation rate for donors who received a 1:1 match.\nThe estimated donation rate under the 1:1 match was 2.07%, which is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The 2:1 and 3:1 match groups had slightly higher rates—2.26% and 2.27%, respectively—but the differences (coefficients of 0.0019 and 0.0020) were not statistically significant (p = 0.3383 and 0.3133).\nThese findings are consistent with earlier t-test results and with the original study by Karlan and List (2007). They suggest that increasing the match ratio doesn’t meaningfully affect donation likelihood. Instead, it appears that the key behavioral lever is simply the presence of a match offer, not how generous the match is.\n\nmean_by_ratio &lt;- treat_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(ratio) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nmean_by_ratio\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      ratio response_rate\n  &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1        0.0207\n2         2        0.0226\n3         3        0.0227\n\n\n\ndiff_2_1 &lt;- mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 2] - mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 1]\ndiff_3_2 &lt;- mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 3] - mean_by_ratio$response_rate[mean_by_ratio$ratio == 2]\n\ndiff_2_1\n\n[1] 0.001884251\n\ndiff_3_2\n\n[1] 0.000100024\n\n\n\ncoef_table &lt;- tidy(reg_ratio)\n\nbaseline &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"(Intercept)\"]\ncoef_2_1 &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"ratio2\"]\ncoef_3_1 &lt;- coef_table$estimate[coef_table$term == \"ratio3\"]\n\nfitted_2 &lt;- baseline + coef_2_1\nfitted_3 &lt;- baseline + coef_3_1\n\ndiff_2_1_fitted &lt;- coef_2_1\ndiff_3_2_fitted &lt;- coef_3_1 - coef_2_1\n\ndiff_2_1_fitted\n\n[1] 0.001884251\n\ndiff_3_2_fitted\n\n[1] 0.000100024\n\n\nTo further assess the effectiveness of different match sizes, I compared donation rates between match ratios using two approaches:\n(1) directly from the observed data, and\n(2) indirectly using fitted values from the regression model.\nThe difference in donation rates between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups was approximately 0.00188, or 0.19 percentage points. Between the 2:1 and 3:1 match groups, the difference was only 0.00010, or 0.01 percentage points. These differences were exactly confirmed using the regression coefficients, which adds confidence to the consistency of the findings.\nWhile the differences are numerically real, both are very small in magnitude and, as shown earlier, not statistically significant. This reinforces the conclusion that although a matching offer increases donations compared to no match, increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not meaningfully boost response rates.\nThe key takeaway is clear: the existence of a match matters more than its generosity. For fundraisers, this insight suggests that match framing can be powerful—even without increasing the cost of the match itself.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nt_test_amount &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\n\nreg_amount &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_amount, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    0.813    0.0674     12.1   0        0.681      0.945\n2 treatment      0.154    0.0826      1.86  0.0628  -0.0082     0.315\n\n\nI began by examining the effect of the treatment on total donation amounts using a simple linear regression. This analysis includes all individuals, regardless of whether they actually donated.\nThe results show that participants in the treatment group gave, on average, $0.15 more than those in the control group (estimate = 0.1536). However, this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.0628).\nThis suggests that while the treatment group may have contributed slightly more overall, the difference could be driven primarily by a higher number of people donating, not by larger gifts among donors. In other words, this part of the analysis reflects the extensive margin (whether someone donates), not the intensive margin (how much they give once they do).\n\ndonors_only &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\nreg_amount_conditional &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = donors_only)\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(reg_amount_conditional, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    45.5       2.42    18.8     0        40.8      50.3 \n2 treatment      -1.67      2.87    -0.581   0.562    -7.30      3.97\n\n\nNext, I restricted the analysis to only those individuals who actually made a donation.\nAmong donors, the average donation amount in the control group was $45.54, while donors in the treatment group gave $1.67 less on average. This difference is again not statistically significant (p = 0.5615).\nThese results suggest that once someone decides to donate, the matching offer has no clear effect on how much they give. Combined with the earlier finding that matching increases the likelihood of giving, this implies that the treatment works mainly by encouraging people to donate, not by changing donation size.\n\ndonors_only &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(gave == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = ifelse(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\"))\n\nmean_amounts &lt;- donors_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_amt = mean(amount, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(donors_only, aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(data = mean_amounts,\n             aes(xintercept = mean_amt),\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ group) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Donation Amounts by Group (Among Donors Only)\",\n    x = \"Donation Amount ($)\",\n    y = \"Number of Donors\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram above shows the distribution of donation amounts for each group.\nAt first glance, the two distributions appear almost identical—both are centered around $45–$50 and have a similar shape. The dashed red lines represent the group averages: approximately $45.5 for the control group and slightly lower for the treatment group.\nSurprisingly, those in the treatment group actually gave a bit less than the control group. But again, this difference is not statistically meaningful, and most likely due to random variation.\nSo what can we take away from this? While a matching offer can successfully nudge people to donate, it doesn’t influence how generous they are once they’ve made that decision. The effect seems to operate on whether someone acts, not how much they give—an important insight for designing effective fundraising strategies."

Early on, we see a lot of noise—the line bounces around as randomness dominates small sample sizes. But as the number of simulations increases, the fluctuations smooth out and the line settles near the true value.\nThis convergence gives us confidence in the reliability of our estimates. The more data we collect, the closer we get to the underlying truth—even when individual observations are binary and noisy, like whether someone donates.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nsample_sizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\nnum_simulations &lt;- 1000\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──\n\n\n✔ tibble  3.1.5     ✔ purrr   1.0.2\n✔ tidyr   1.1.4     ✔ stringr 1.4.0\n✔ readr   2.0.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nsim_results &lt;- lapply(sample_sizes, function(n) {\n  diffs &lt;- replicate(num_simulations, {\n    treat &lt;- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.022)\n    control &lt;- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.018)\n    mean(treat) - mean(control)\n  })\n  tibble(\n    diff = diffs,\n    sample_size = n\n  )\n}) %&gt;% bind_rows()\n\n\nggplot(sim_results, aes(x = diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ sample_size, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Simulated Mean Differences\",\n    subtitle = \"Across Varying Sample Sizes (Central Limit Theorem)\",\n    x = \"Average Treatment - Control\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histograms below illustrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in action.\nFor each sample size—50, 200, 500, and 1000—I repeatedly simulated the average difference in donation rates between a treatment group (with donation probability = 0.022) and a control group (0.018). Each histogram shows the distribution of these simulated mean differences.\nAs the sample size increases, the distribution becomes smoother, more symmetric, and narrower. With only 50 observations, the results are jagged and spread out—random chance can easily mask the treatment effect. But by the time we reach 1000 observations, the distribution clusters tightly around the true value (≈ 0.004), and resembles a classic bell curve.\nThe red dashed line at zero represents the “no effect” case. In small samples, it’s often close to the center of the distribution. But in large samples, zero moves to the tail, meaning the evidence increasingly rules out no effect.\nThis is exactly why the CLT is so powerful in applied work: with large enough samples, our estimates become well-behaved, normally distributed, and centered near the truth, even when the raw data is binary and highly skewed."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis replication of Karlan and List (2007) confirmed several key insights about how simple behavioral cues can shape charitable giving.\nI was especially struck by how just the presence of a match—regardless of its size—was enough to increase donation rates. Whether the offer was 1:1 or 3:1, donors were equally likely to give. What mattered most was the framing: knowing their donation would be matched seemed to motivate action.\nInterestingly, once people decided to donate, the matching offer didn’t affect how much they gave. This suggests that the treatment primarily affects the decision to give (the extensive margin), rather than the donation amount (the intensive margin).\nAs someone studying data science and business analytics, this project reminded me that small psychological shifts can lead to measurable real-world effects. For fundraisers or policymakers, it’s a strong case for thoughtful design and messaging.\nSometimes, it’s not about offering more. It’s about offering it more effectively."
